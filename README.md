# Rock Paper Scissors

## Description
This program is a rock, paper, and scissors game using Python's OpenCV
and Mediapipe libraries. To play this game, the program must detect
the user's hand gestures to identify whether it synbolizes a rock, paper,
or scissor. Users will compete against the computer in this game to see
who is the winner.

Best of luck! :tada::snake:
